# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of the project is to help Louise with a crowdfunding campaign to help with the funds for her play called "Fever." While using Excel I will be organizing, sorting and analyzing crowdfunding data to aim to make the project campaign successful. This will help Louise have a more understanding of the campaign as a whole.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86431959/123716225-15356d80-d848-11eb-9719-ca19833da325.png) 

In the analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date the visualization was self explanatory. Viewing the line chart there is a positive trend of success starting in March and reaching its peak in May. After May the trend goes down, but the trend is still above any failure or canceled actions throughout the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86431959/123716235-19618b00-d848-11eb-94b8-f06f96bd5590.png)

In the analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals the successful percentage start of strong when the goal is less than $1000, but as the goal increases towards greater than $50000 the percentage decreases. With that said, the failed percentage is low initiating less than $1000 at about 25%, but as the goal increases the failed percentage increases, too reaching a peak of 100% at the $45000 to $49999 goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The challenges and difficulties I encountered were minimal. Some of the functions that needed to be executed were a bit confusing, but I got help from others, as well as watching the video resources that were available which explained step by step on how to execute the functions properly.

## Results

- The two conclusions I can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date are there was a very low percentage of cancellation throughout the year. Throughout the year there the theater outcomes were successful all above 50% except for the month of December.

- The conclusion I can draw about the Outcomes based on Goals is the outcome was at its peak when the goal aimed less than $1000. Starting from $15000 to greater than $50000 the successful and failure outcomes were not steady, but there was also an indication the successful outcome trend was overall decreasing, where as the failed outcome percentage trend was increasing overall.

- Some limitations of this dataset I would say how receiving the donation went about. Was the donation asked in a certain way? The countries or locations were not too broad, as far as the exactly location such as the city.

- A possible table and/or graph that could have been created is a stacked column graph.
